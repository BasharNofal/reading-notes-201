###  HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

#### Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)

To add image in HTML use the following :

`<img src="link of the image"/>`

Some times the browser doesn't load the image, so if you want to show text that represents the image use the following:

`<img src="link of the image" alt="text"/>`

To add description about the image when the user's cursor comes over the image the description appears, use the following:

`<img src="link of the image" title="description"/>`

Regarding the dimensions of the of the image you can use `hight="#px"` and `width="#px"`attributes.

Now, when editing the alignment of the text and the images use the attribute `align=left` to make the text on the left side of the image, and the same for the other 3 directions, but this attribute had been removed form HTML5 and replaced with float propert in CSS.

To add caption to an image use `<figure></figure>` to contain the image and the caption, and use `<figcaption>text<figcaption>` to add the caption itself, as following
