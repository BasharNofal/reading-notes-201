### JS Debugging

#### JavaScript book, Ch. 10, â€œError Handling & Debugging

JavaScript interpreter goes through two processes when running a code:

1- Preparation: where the interpreter goes through the code line by line and then hoists every variable and function at the top of the code before executing it.
And that can be noticed when calling a function before declaring it.

2- Execution: it's abovious from its name, here the interpreter assigns the values to the variable and executes the code.

##### Scopes

Basically scopes think of it like if you are on a certain line of the code and you have a variable that has been called, then can you see where the variable got declared from or not.

There are two types of variables when thinking about scopes: 

1- Global scope variables: the variables that get declared outside function and objects, and they can be accessed from any where in the code.

2- Local scope variables: the variables that get declared outside functions and objects, here you have to use special commands in order to access their values.
