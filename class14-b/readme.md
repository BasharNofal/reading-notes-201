### What Google Learned About Teams

In order to build a good and long lasting team the people in the team have to breake the ice between them, as mentioned in the article by having chat before any meeting, being friends outside the work enviroment, also it's very important that they get to know each others mind.

One more important thing that we might consider when building teams, let's assume that in this cohort for example two groups of five were put together to work on project as a team, the first team's members have different background and before the course they had no idea about software developement, whereas in the other team all or most of their members have knowledge about software developement, in my opinion the second team would have more people to argue or disrespect the others ideas than the first team, and more people would be afraid to tell the others about what in their mind in than the first team, and the reason for that is the first team members might consider the others thoughts is correct because they don't whole a lot about certain topic in software developement, also they might consider that all of the team memebers don't that much knowledge in that topic so they might execuse their mistakes. What I wanted to say is sometimes it's important to have people with different backgrounds in the same team.
